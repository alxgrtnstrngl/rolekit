    <para>
      rolekit is a server role deployment and management toolkit. A server role could be seen as a service or a use case that is providing several services. A deployed role is a (role) instance.
    </para>
    <para>
      A plugin interface is used for simple role creation. Each role is a plugin to rolekit and can therefore be easily created. A D-Bus interface and also a command line client is available for role management.
    </para>

    <para>
      A role plugin describes the receipt to get to the configured and running role. For this a plugin provides a predefined set of methods and role settings (properties).
    </para>
    <para>
      Roles are loaded from the <filename><config.rolekit_roles/></filename> directory. Each role owns a directory named after the role itself. The directory contains role.py, that is inherited from RoleBase and implementing the role.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each role instance owns a sub directory in <filename><config.etc_rolekit_roles/></filename>, named after the role. The directory contains JSON settings files using the name of the instances as the filename with the JSON extension.
    </para>

    <para>
      While deploying a role, these steps are done internally:
